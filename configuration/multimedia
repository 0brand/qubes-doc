This short howto will explain how you can use Spotify, Netflix or Amazon Prime under Qubes OS.
This steps have been tested by providing an own "multimedia" App VM which is based on the Qubes OS Debian 8 Template VM.

Listen to Spotify

Install-Howto: https://www.spotify.com/de/download/linux/

Detailed steps:

1) sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys BBEBDCB318AD50EC6865090613B00F1FD2C19886
2) echo deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list
3) sudo apt-get update
4) sudo apt-get install spotify-client

I could then start the native spotify client .. easy.


Play Netflix
The built in Firefox (from the Debian Template VM) was Firefox ESR 45.3.0
According to the "supported browser" list Mozilla Firefox >= 47.x is needed.
I've thereoff installed Firefox v53.0.2 according to this manual:
http://libre-software.net/how-to-install-firefox-on-ubuntu-linux-mint/

1) download firefox from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?scene=2
direct download link:
https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/53.0.2/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-53.0.2.tar.bz2

2) unpack the downloaded file
tar -xjf firefox-53.0.2.tar.bz2

3) move the unpacked folder:
sudo mv firefox /opt/firefox53

4) Create a symlink to the new firefox version:
if you want to use the new installed firefox as "standard firefox", rename the original link in case you want to go back to the previous version
sudo mv /usr/bin/firefox /usr/bin/firefox-old
Create a link to the new firefox version
sudo ln -s /opt/firefox53/firefox /usr/bin/firefox

5) Launch firefox and open Preferences, Content and enable "Play DRM content"
That's it, login into Netflix and enjoy.


How to use Amazon Prime
If you have setup everything to watch netflix (see above), Amazon Prime should also work.
Enjoy"
