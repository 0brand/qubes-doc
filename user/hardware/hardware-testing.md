# Hardware Testing

The Qubes developers test Qubes OS on certain hardware models.

## Tested Models

These hardware models have been (and continue to be) tested and work well with Qubes OS:

 - Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 5

Note: The Lenovo X and T series are similar enough to assume similar compatibility of the matching model from the other series.

## Desired Models

The Qubes devs would like to tese these models, but the hardware is not available to us.
If anyone is willing to lend or donate these models to us, we would be happy to test them:

 - Lenovo Thinkpad T or X series with Intel 8th Gen CPU and integrated graphics
 - Dell Latitude with Intel 8th Gen CPU and integrated graphics

Note: The Lenovo X and T series are similar enough to assume similar compatibility of the matching model from the other series.
